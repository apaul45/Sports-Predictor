                    <p>Future stats are determined by a variety of factors, some of which are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Player's Age (Are they entering a prime? Leaving? In it?)</li>
                            <li>Current state of their team (Is their team losing? The more they are, the more that player gets to shine</li>
                            <li>Future state of their team (Any free agent moves? Big draft picks?)</li>
                            <li>Position (Some get more possession than others)</li>
                        </ul>
                        None of this should be taken seriously of course, as it is impossible to guarantee what a player will 
                        do in the future.
