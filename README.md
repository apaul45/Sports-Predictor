## Factors
The following were used to determine which way a player's statistics point (increase, no change, or decrease).
- Age 
- Health
- Player Role & Team State (Standing & Health)

The resulting score is taken and applied proportionately to each of the common statistics.

The following APIs were used in the basketball portion of this website:
